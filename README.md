C.	Shipments (Upcoming shipments - orders from the user-buyer cabinet. Principle of work: all movements of the stone must be fixed, so when the master wants to ship this or that position - he must request permission from the cabinet "cerber" (confirms whether the payment for a particular position that the master wants to ship) and "Quarry Manager" (gives final permission for shipment if he is satisfied with everything) )
